# Rust-WASM experiments ðŸ¦€ ðŸ•¸

## ðŸ¥ª Instructions

1. Compile to WASM and create a NPM package with `wasm-pack build --target bundler`.
2. Go to `/site`.
3. Link the folder `/pkg` to `hello-wasm` package with [npm-link](<https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link>).
    1. go to `pkg/` and execute `npm link`
    2. go to site and run `npm link hello-wasm`
4. Install with `npm i` and run webpack server with `npm run dev`.

### Sun 21 Aug 2022

Follow MDN tutorial, [Rust-WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm).

- Created a library crate
- Use `wasm_bindgen` to generate bindings:
  - Call JS's `alert` from Rust
  - Call a Rust function `greet` from JS
- Compiled to WASM
- Tests on local server
- Create a NPM symlink package
- Import NPM symlink into a sample project
- Run the sample project

This was similar to <https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/hello-world.html> although that seems to be a bit out of date, check the comment on webpack imports

Next:

- Configure TypeScript in the sample project, and check imports and definitions.

### Mon 22 Aug 2022

Done today:

- Updated to webpack 5
- Transpiled using SWC ðŸ¦€
- Added TypeScript
- Used top level await and wasm async experimental features
- A very rude performance test

Next:

- Try something more ambitious, follow up tutorial from rust-wasm book

### Sat 1 Oct 2022

Done today:

- Adapted example from [rust-wasm book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html) to use TypeScript and SWC on Webpack.
