## Sun 21 Aug 2022

Follow MDN tutorial, [Rust-WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm).

- Created a library crate
- Use `wasm_bindgen` to generate bindings:
  - Call JS's `alert` from Rust
  - Call a Rust function `greet` from JS
- Compiled to WASM
- Tests on local server
- Create a NPM symlink package
- Import NPM symlink into a sample project
- Run the sample project

This was similar to <https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/hello-world.html> although that seems to be a bit out of date, check the comment on webpack imports

Next:

- Configure TypeScript in the sample project, and check imports and definitions.
