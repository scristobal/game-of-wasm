- [ ] Move to Trunk
- [ ] Remaining exercises [time-optimization](<https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/time-profiling.html#exercises>) and [size-optimization](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/code-size.html#exercises)
- [ ] Check out `js_ffi` or [`js-wasm`](<https://github.com/richardanaya/js-wasm>) as the former seems deprecated
- [ ] Check out the [`js!` macro](https://docs.rs/stdweb/0.4.0/stdweb/macro.js.html)

# ðŸ—“ change log

## Sun 21 Aug 2022

Follow MDN tutorial, [Rust-WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm).

- Created a library crate
- Use `wasm_bindgen` to generate bindings:
  - Call JS's `alert` from Rust
  - Call a Rust function `greet` from JS
- Compiled to WASM
- Tests on local server
- Create a NPM symlink package
- Import NPM symlink into a sample project
- Run the sample project

This was similar to <https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/hello-world.html> although that seems to be a bit out of date, check the comment on webpack imports

Next:

- Configure TypeScript in the sample project, and check imports and definitions.

## Mon 22 Aug 2022

Done today:

- Updated to webpack 5
- Transpiled using SWC ðŸ¦€
- Added TypeScript
- Used top level await and wasm async experimental features
- A very rude performance test

Next:

- Try something more ambitious, follow up tutorial from rust-wasm book

## Sat 1 Oct 2022

Done today:

- Adapted example from [rust-wasm book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/introduction.html) to use TypeScript and SWC on Webpack.
- Followed until <https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/implementing.html#rendering-to-canvas-directly-from-memory>

Next:

- Continue book example

## Sun 2 Oct 2022

- Published to NPM <https://www.npmjs.com/package/glife-wasm>
- Deployed to Vercel <https://samuelsh-glife-wasm.vercel.app/>

- Bug hunting re. `wasm-pack build`  <https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/990>
- Exercises section 4.4 rust-wasm book

## Sun 9 Oct 2022

- Added custom elements manifest and VScode custom data format
- House keepin: updates, package.json, READMEs, etc.
